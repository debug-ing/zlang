# ZLang 

ZLang is not just a programming languageâ€”it's a piece of my heart, a reflection of a love that once was and will always remain a part of me.

I created ZLang in memory of someone who was my everything but is no longer by my side. Every line of code carries whispers of the love we shared, every function a reminder of the dreams we built together. This language is my way of preserving their essence, a small tribute to the beautiful moments that shaped me.

ZLang is still under development.


Forever in my heart.
